## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Playing the Game

The goal of the game is to correctly select all 8 pairs of cards.

To begin, click on a card from the deck to reveal that card's icon. Once the first card is flipped, select another card from the deck to reveal that card's icon.

If the two cards have matching icons, the cards will remain revealed. If the cards do not match, they will be hidden once again, but the icons will keep their position in the deck. Remembering where the icons are in the deck is the key to winning the game quickly! Hence, the name "Memory!"

## Star Rating and Number of Moves

When two cards are selected, that is considered one move. 

If the game is not completed by the 16th move, the star rating will drop from 3 to 2.

If the game is not completed by the 24th move, the star rating will drop from 2 to 1.
